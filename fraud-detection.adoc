== Overview

Fraud is a burgeoning problem that costs businesses billions of dollars in lost money and time annually. Detecting and investigating fraud with traditional methods is hard; fraudsters use increasingly complex techniques to hide their activities, and their patterns of activity are difficult or impossible to uncover with relational models. Even in cases where the patterns can be specified in SQL, the resulting queries are complex to write and perform poorly because of the large number of joins needed.

With Neo4j, you can use a flexible, native graph database plus algorithms to build applications for uncovering and investigating complex fraud, helping identify suspicious activity quickly and accurately to increase uplift in scoring models. Rapidly match complex patterns in data and relationships, expose paths and intermediaries to fraudulent actors using advanced algorithms, and find duplicate and suspicious profiles using entity resolution.

== Graph model

The graph model contains the following:

* *Customer* - an entity such as a person or business that holds one or more accounts at the financial institution.
* *Account* - an account at a financial institution. If the account is at “our” institution (the one that is building the fraud detection graph), then we can call it an “internal” account. Accounts at other institutions can be called “external” accounts. If an external account is an institution located in a designated high-risk jurisdiction, the Account node will also have a HighRiskJurisdiction label.
* *Transaction* - are between two accounts, at least one of which must be internal (after all, we have no visibility into transactions between accounts at other institutions unless one side of the transaction is at our institution).
* *Email, PhoneNumber, Address* - these nodes store demographic information for Customers

== Next steps

Now that you have seen how you can use Neo4j to find suspicious patterns in banking activity, you might want to explore further.

* Load your own data into the same graph data model and run the same queries from this demo. An easy way to do this is to create relational tables or CSV files that match the format of the https://github.com/neo4j-product-examples/demo-fraud/tree/master/data[data] and use https://github.com/neo4j-product-examples/demo-fraud/blob/master/model/neo4j_importer_model.json[neo4j_importer_model.json] to load the data using AuraDB’s data import service.
* Explore some other suspicious patterns that might indicate fraud:
** Transfers to Account Holders on a watch list
** Transfers to and from cash-intensive businesses (which are commonly used by money launderers due to the difficulty of tracing physical cash)
